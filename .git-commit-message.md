Convert spaces to hyphens in filenames

- Add preprocessing step to convert spaces to hyphens in all paths
- Create temporary directory for processed files
- Update image file handling to use hyphenated names
- Modify Docker mount points to use processed files
- Add cleanup of temporary files

This change takes a different approach to handling spaces in filenames by
converting them to hyphens. This makes the files more URL-friendly and
easier to handle in shell scripts. The workflow now:
1. Creates a temporary directory with processed filenames
2. Converts all file and directory names to use hyphens
3. Processes the files from the temporary location
4. Cleans up temporary files after processing

Example transformation:
"DB history in Mobile/presentation.md" â†’ "DB-history-in-Mobile/presentation.md"
