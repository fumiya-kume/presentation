Simplify Marp workflow implementation

- Consolidate file finding and path processing into a single command
- Add helper functions for common operations
  - generate_output: handles all Marp CLI operations
  - copy_images: handles image file copying with path conversion
- Remove temporary directory approach in favor of direct processing
- Simplify file and directory handling
- Reduce code duplication in Docker commands
- Improve readability with better organization and comments

The workflow now:
1. Uses a single find command with combined filters
2. Processes files in-place with minimal temporary files
3. Uses functions to reduce code duplication
4. Has clearer separation of concerns between steps
5. Maintains the same functionality with less complexity

Example transformation:
"DB history in Mobile/presentation.md" â†’ "DB-history-in-Mobile/presentation.md"
